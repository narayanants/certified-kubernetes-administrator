K8s Concepts:
=============

    - API Server - Communication between master and worker node
    - ETCD - Store all info happening in K8s
    - Scheduler - Schedule which pod to place in which node
    - Control Manager - Controls Nodes and ReplicaSets
    - Kubelet - Registers nodes and creates PODs
    - Kubeproxy - Direct Traffic from POD via Service
    - Kubectl - CLI for interacting with K8s
    - ReplicaSets - Maintain ReplicaSets in Nodes
    - Deployments - Updates and Rollbacks
    - Service - Connect various components in the worker nodes
    - Namespaces - define a boundary for your worker nodes
    - DaemonSets - One DS per cluster inside a POD
    - Labels and Selectors - Label your deployments and services
    - Node Selectors - Select which node is perfect for the right workload
    - Rollouts and Updates
    - ConfigMaps - Store config data in Key:value pairs
    - Secrets - Store confidential info in a hashed k:v format
    - Cluster Upgrade process
    - Backup and Restore - Taking snapshot of the ETCD Server
    - Switching and Routing
    - DNS Basics
    - Taints and Tolerations
    - Node Affinity
    - Node Selectors
    - PersistentVolumes
    - PersistentVolumeClaims
